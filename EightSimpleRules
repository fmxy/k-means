Following Clay Breshears 'The Art of Concurrency'

Rule 1: Identify Truly Independent Computations

Centroid Computatation: If all data points of a cluster are known, the sum  (parallel reduction) can and therefore the centroid of a cluster can be calculated separately (by division)

Distance Calculation: Each points distance to cluster centroids can be calculated separately

Point Assignment: Each point can be assigned to the cluster containing the closest cluster centroid separately

BUT: Synchronization step

For problems, see chapter 11.1, 'Structured Parallel Programming' by McCool, Robison, Reinders
